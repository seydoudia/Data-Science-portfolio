**Project Achievements**
* Processed 4 year historical data from an electric meter at a 1 minute timestep
* Used Kmeans algortihm in order to identify consumption profiles from a household's electric meter
* Found optimal number of centeroids with silhouette method
* Validating results with t-SNE dimensionality reduction
