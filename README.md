Optimal planning and operation of a power generation fleet consists in deciding on the operating schedule of the generation units to meet the forecasted load over a given time horizon, taking into account the technical constraints that govern the operation of the units while minimizing operating costs. In this project we study the development of a Mixed-Integer-Linear-Programming (MILP) model to optimize the management of 27 thermal power plants and 2 hydroelectric plants to meet a specific demand at an hourly timestep. We present the entire model as well as the code developed in python.<br>
*This project was conducted during the Msc. in Energy Systems Optimization of Mines ParisTech in collaboration with Ms. [Simona MILADINOVA](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/simona-miladinova-839b8a17a/fr) and under the supervising of Ms. [Sophie DEMASSEY](http://sofdem.github.io/), associate professor at **Mines ParisTech**. This work resulted in a detailed report that is not presented in the notebook.*

# [Project 4: Forecasting Monthly Energy Consumption in Siberia (2021)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/sdia_prj3_siberia_forecasting_nb1.ipynb)

**Project Goals** <br> Perform time series forecasting with:
* [SARIMA - Seasonal Autoregression Integrated Moving Average](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/sdia_prj3_siberia_forecasting_nb1.ipynb)


# [Project 3: Exploratory Data Analysis of 50 hard drives available storage to prevent saturation (2021)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/sdia_prj_infologic.ipynb)
In the era of big data, where the benefits of data are too often emphasized, we often forget the issue of storage.  With 1 million trillion Kbytes of data generated every day, we need to be able to size storage systems adapted to our needs and avoid saturation while limiting the resources used. In this project, we are exploring the availability rates of 50 different hard disks to study their evolution and establish the best models to provide information on their saturation date.<br> *This study was conducted by [Ms. Simona Miladinova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simona-miladinova-839b8a17a/) and myself as part of the CIX research program of INSA Lyon in collaboration with the company [INFOLOGIC](https://www.infologic-copilote.fr/), which distributes an ERP software for the food industry and provided us with their data.
It was carried out under the direction of [Mr. Mehdi Kaytoue](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/mehdikaytoue) and [Mr. Anes Bendimerad](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/anes-bendimerad-90670265), both members of the R&D section of INFOLOGIC.*

# [Research Work 2: Big Data at the service of socio-economic development in poor countries (2019)](https://github.com/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/Big_Data_SDG.pdf) 
*PAPER IN FRENCH*

**Abstract**<br>
We often hear about Big Data and AI as technologies for maximizing corporate profit or for mass surveillance. But who would have thought that these new tools could be useful for the socio-economic development of developing countries. This is what this research paper is trying to achieve by exploring how machine learning and data science can contribute to the development of poor and developing countries or prevent humanitarian crisis situations.<br>*This work was carried out as part of INSA Lyon's Personal Project in Humanity (PPH).*
