# [Project 3: Forecasting Monthly Energy Consumption in Siberia (2021)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/sdia_prj3_siberia_forecast_nb1.ipynb)

**Project Goals** <br> Perform time series forecasting with:
* [SARIMA - Seasonal Autoregression Integrated Moving Average](https://github.com/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/sdia_prj3_siberia_forecast_nb1.ipynb)
* XGBoost Regressor (_Coming soon_)
* LASSO Regularised Regression (_Coming soon_)


# [Project 2: Predicting the energy output of a power plant with multiple linear regressions (2020)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/sdia_prj2_pwr_plant_pred.ipynb)
if link doesn't work, click [HERE](https://github.com/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/sdia_prj2_pwr_plant_pred.ipynb) to access project

**Project Achievements**
* Built two multiple linear regression models with both Scikit-Learn and Stats Model
* Verified linear regression assumptions (linearity, residual mean of 0, homoscedasticity, abscence of residual correlation etc.)
* Analysed multi-collinearity in features using variance inflation factor method
* Tested homoscedasticity hypothesis with Breusch-Pagan test


# [Project 1: Identifying a household's energy fingerprint with KMeans clustering (2020)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/sdia_prj1_cluster_household.ipynb)
if link doesn't work, click [HERE](https://github.com/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/sdia_prj1_cluster_household.ipynb) to access project

**Project Achievements**
* Processed 4 year historical data from an electric meter at a 1 minute timestep
* Used KMeans algorithm in order to identify electricity usage profiles of a household
* Found optimal number of centeroids with silhouette method
* Validating results with t-SNE dimensionality reduction


# [Research Work 2: Big Data at the service of socio-economic development in poor countries (2019)](https://github.com/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/Big_Data_SDG.pdf) 
*PAPER IN FRENCH*

**Abstract**<br>
We often hear about Big Data and AI as technologies for maximizing corporate profit or for mass surveillance. But who would have thought that these new tools could be useful for the socio-economic development of developing countries. This is what this research paper is trying to achieve by exploring how machine learning and data science can contribute to the development of poor and developing countries or prevent humanitarian crisis situations.<br>*This work was carried out as part of INSA Lyon's Personal Project in Humanity (PPH).*

# [Research Work 1: Study of a Neural Network for image classification of the MNIST database (2019)](https://github.com/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/B15_DIA_MILADINOVA.pdf)
*PAPER IN FRENCH*

**Project Achievements**
* Analysed a neural network developed in MATLAB and C++
* Performed a comparative study of the performances of both programming languages
* Used Stochastic Gradient descent and mini-batch method
* Studied optimal number of layers and node to perform classification<br>*This work was carried out as part of INSA Lyon's CLANU Project in collaboration with Ms. Simona MILADINOVA([Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simona-miladinova-839b8a17a/)).*

# About Me
**Seydou DIA**

![profile picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seydoudia/Data-Science-portfolio/master/no_bg.png "profile pic") <br>
**I am an engineering student at INSA Lyon who likes to contribute to Data Science projects in relation with the energy sector and the development of Smart Grids. Mindful of the current climate and economic challenges, I firmly believe that the energy transition will be made with the help of NICTs and soft technologies.**
