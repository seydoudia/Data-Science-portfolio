# [Project 8: How is road diesel reported in international energy statistics (2025) (2025)](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/Road_diesel_study_output_blog.html)
In this note we explore how road diesel is reported within the oil information dataset published by the International Energy Agency. Our focus is on understanding the approaches countries use to report road diesel demand, viewed through the lens of energy statistics. In this work we are looking at 2023 road diesel demand data and presenting the definitions of diesel products according to international energy statistics in OECD countries as well the economic sectors for which road diesel demand is reported. This data is reported through annual questionnaires and directly reported to the IEA by statistical authorities within reporting countries.

# [Project 7: Building S&P500 portfolios with decreasing carbon footprints (2022)](https://github.com/seydoudia/portfolio_optimization)

In this project, we analyze different asset management strategies as well as KPIs to compare them. The project simulates investment strategies throughout the duration of 20 years with models such as Equally Weighted, Global Minimum Variance, Max Decorrelation, Max Diversification Maximum Sharpe Ratio.
The assets are initially selected by taking into account the 5 best assets with the lowest carbon footprint from each of the 10 sectors of the S&P500. For each optimization strategy, the objective functions are penalized by each asset's carbon footprint. The result are then analyzed with KPIs including : Return, Volatility, Information Ratio, Diversification Index, Sharpe Ratio, Tracking Error, Excess Return.

In this work we study an optimization model of electricity coupled markets that maximizes welfare. The goal of the project is to analyze the impact of interconnections on electricity prices. We first conduct the study with 3 price zones each containing 100 offers and buyers. We then extend the model to a 35 zones problem. The two indicators analyzed are congestion rent and price convergence. *This project was conducted during the Msc. in Energy Systems Optimization of Mines ParisTech in collaboration with [Ms. Simona MILADINOVA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simona-miladinova-839b8a17a/) and under the supervising of Mr. [Jean-Paul MARMORAT](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/Services/Annuaire/jean-paul-marmorat), research director at Mines ParisTech*.

# [Research Work 3: Dynamic Pricing of Electricity: interest & limits (2022)](https://github.com/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/sdia_electricity_dynamic_pricing.pdf)
*PAPER IN FRENCH*

In this work we study the relevance on dynamic pricing in which small consumers would be exposed to variable electricity price. The price structures analysed in our document range from Time-of-Use and Peak-Time-Rebates to Increasing-Block-Tariff-Rate and Critical Peak Pricing as well as Real-Time Pricing. We study experiments that have been conducted in Spain, Ethiopia, Norvegia, France and the US, to assess the interests and limits of these pricing method. *This project was conducted during the Msc. in Energy Systems Optimization of Mines ParisTech in collaboration with Ms. [Simona MILADINOVA](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/simona-miladinova-839b8a17a/fr) It is the result of a 4 months project as part of the energy economics course taught by [J. PERCEBOIS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Percebois), director of the  Centre de recherche en économie et droit de l'énergie (CREDEN), and [F. MIRABEL](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/fran%C3%A7ois-mirabel-65b13626), dean of the faculty of economics of Montpellier, France.* 

**Key take aways** :
* Variable pricing can send strong price signals and incentive to load shifting
* Reflecting the real price of electricity can help investments in renwables energies, storage systems and avoid additional capacity deployment
* Real-Time-Pricing transfers all the risk to small consumers and exposes them to very high prices
* Methods such as CPP and VPP are a good compromise between consumers and electricty providers to minimize price risk and secure solvency of suppliers


# [Project 5: Development of a MILP to optimize the operational cost of power generation assets (2021)](https://nbviewer.org/github/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/sdia_milp_prj5.ipynb)

Optimal planning and operation of a power generation fleet consists in deciding on the operating schedule of the generation units to meet the forecasted load over a given time horizon, taking into account the technical constraints that govern the operation of the units while minimizing operating costs. In this project we study the development of a Mixed-Integer-Linear-Programming (MILP) model to optimize the management of 27 thermal power plants and 2 hydroelectric plants to meet a specific demand at an hourly timestep. We present the entire model as well as the code developed in python.<br>

# [Project 3: Exploratory Data Analysis of 50 hard drives available storage to prevent saturation (2021)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/seydoudia/ml_energy/blob/master/sdia_prj_infologic.ipynb)
In the era of big data, where the benefits of data are too often emphasized, we often forget the issue of storage.  With 1 million trillion Kbytes of data generated every day, we need to be able to size storage systems adapted to our needs and avoid saturation while limiting the resources used. In this project, we are exploring the availability rates of 50 different hard disks to study their evolution and establish the best models to provide information on their saturation date.<br> *This study was conducted by [Ms. Simona Miladinova](https://www.linkedin.com/in/simona-miladinova-839b8a17a/) and myself as part of the CIX research program of INSA Lyon in collaboration with the company [INFOLOGIC](https://www.infologic-copilote.fr/), which distributes an ERP software for the food industry and provided us with their data.

*PAPER IN FRENCH*

**Abstract**<br>
We often hear about Big Data and AI as technologies for maximizing corporate profit or for mass surveillance. But who would have thought that these new tools could be useful for the socio-economic development of developing countries. This is what this research paper is trying to achieve by exploring how machine learning and data science can contribute to the development of poor and developing countries or prevent humanitarian crisis situations.<br>*This work was carried out as part of INSA Lyon's Personal Project in Humanity (PPH).*
