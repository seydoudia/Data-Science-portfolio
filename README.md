**Project Achievements**
* Processed 4 year historical data from an electric meter at a 1 minute timestep
* Used KMeans algorithm in order to identify electricity usage profiles of a household
* Found optimal number of centeroids with silhouette method
* Validating results with t-SNE dimensionality reduction

# (Coming soon) [Project 2: Predicting the energy output of power plant with multiple linear regressions (2020)]()

**I am an engineering student at INSA Lyon who likes to contribute to Data Science projects in relation with the energy sector and the development of Smart Grids. Mindful of the current climate and economic challenges, I firmly believe that the energy transition will be made with the help of NICTs and soft technologies.**
